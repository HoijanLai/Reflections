1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When sharing and cooperating is needed.
  command:
  $git remote (-v)   ##see remote list, -v means verbose
  $git remote add [name] [URL]   ##create a new remote named name with url URL.
  $git push [remote-name] [local-branch]
